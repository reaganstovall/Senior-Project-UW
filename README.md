# Senior Project for UW Computer Engineering 2017
### Intro 
The main idea behind our project was to create a device that could be used by an average person to automate most projects. The Run code is specific to the shield designed by us and implemented on a Raspberry pie 3. While it is possible to replicate exactly what we’ve done without our shield, many modifications may be necessary. 

### Shield
The shield was designed using DipTrace Software, but we've included the necessary Gerber files and schematics for any who wish to replicate our project.

### User Interface
The UI is based on Python 3 and is set to display of a 7” touch screen. It requires Tkinter which can be downloaded using 
<pre class="brush: python;">
sudo apt-get install tkinter
</pre>
